        <p>
            I started building this website (the one you are currently reading!) in late August 2023,
            after realizing that I really needed some kind of digital portfolio for my gamedev and software projects.
            At that time, I was working at Amazon on the Prime Gaming Fulfillment team.
            Amazon had announced a "return to office" policy back in February, and in the summer, it was announced
            that this policy would also affect virtual employees like myself.
            My options were to relocate to Seattle, transfer to another Amazon role close by, or resign.
            I took the internal transfer option, but could sense a change in the winds coming,
            so I started applying to other companies, and began this portfolio site to make myself more attractive to gamedev studios.
            This was a good call, as my role was later eliminated in November 2023 during a round of layoffs across Prime Gaming.

        <h2 class="text-center display-2">Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            The initial codebase for the "Dansite" was copied from the <a href="/projects/websites/derploid-site">Derploid® Entertainment site</a>
            that I built in 2022. This included:
            <ul>
                <li>Infrastructure as Code using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cdk" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a> for all backend resources</li>
                <li>TLS certs through <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>AWS Certificate Manager</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Route53</a> HostedZones for DNS management and redirects</li>
                <li>The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Jekyll</a> static site generator for web content</li>
                <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Bootstrap</a> for web components and CSS utility classes</li>
                <li><a href="https://pages.github.com" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>GitHub Pages</a> for hosting</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This setup has worked very well, but Jekyll is unfortunately a pretty out-dated tool
            <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/14/future_of_jekyll_project_engine/" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>without a clear future</a>.
            As of this writing in January 2024, I am strongly considering shifting to <a href="https://nextjs.org/" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Next.js</a>,
            a static site generator that is very actively maintained and would give me more practice with <a href="https://react.dev/" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>React</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Some other little engineering details that I'm proud of include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Inclusion of embedded slides and recordings for most of my <a href="/#nav-tab-talks">talks</a>.
                This content is hosted for free on OneDrive, and adds more interactivity/professionalism to those project pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                The talk recordings also forced me to learn a lot more about video editing and transcoding
                to make sure they were correctly formatted for the web.
            </li>
            <li>
                The little "Dan cartoon" avatar that I use all over this site was created by my good friend and Derploid® business partner,
                {% include contact-link.html contact="mattSamardge" %}.
            </li>
            <li>
                Creating HTTP redirects to get <code>danvicarel.com</code>, <code>.net</code>, and <code>.org</code> (with or without <code>www.</code>)
                all redirecting to the same home page
            </li>
            <li>Using appropriate SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to the site's DNS records to prevent abuse by scammers</li>
            <li>
                Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>AWS CloudWatch</a> alarms
                to monitor the website's DNSSEC and HTTP health
            </li>
            <li>Defining <a href="https://containers.dev" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>devcontainers</a> for developing the CDK app and Jekyll content</li>
        </ul>
