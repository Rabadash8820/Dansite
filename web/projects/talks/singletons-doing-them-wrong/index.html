                    In this talk, veteran game developer and software engineer Dan Vicarel will guide you through the pros and cons
                    of the controversial "singleton pattern".
                    It can be quite confusing to talk about "clean code architecture" in the abstract, so we'll be using a simple 2D game for reference.
                    We will explore three different ways to architect the same game: procedural methods, static singletons, and dependency injection.
                    Whether you're completely new to gameplay programming, or want to see how familiar patterns and principles from computer science
                    can be applied to games, there will be something enlightening here for everyone.
