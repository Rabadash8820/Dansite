                    Yes, you read that correctly.
                    In this somewhat tongue-in-cheek presentation, veteran game developer and software engineer Dan Vicarel will walk you through
                    the trials and tribulations of conditional logic.
                    We'll discuss common pitfalls and code smells, as well as principles to follow for improving the readability and extendibility of your code.
                    No matter your experience level, sometimes its good to get back to the basics.
                    Seriously, some programmers REALLY need to get back to the basics.
