                    In this live demo, veteran gameplay engineer, Dan Vicarel, will guide you through building an interactive enemy
                    for a 2D "space shooter" video game, complete with graphics, sounds, basic AI/pathfinding, and health/damage.
                    The focus will be on the programming for such an enemy, but you will also learn about tricks for animation, sound design, and more.
                    The demo will use the Unity Engine, but Dan's approach to game architecture, with an emphasis on loosely coupled components and data-driven design,
                    should provide useful insights that can be applied to systems in any game, on any engine.
