                    Do you want to monetize your mobile game with ads, without annoying players, but don't know where to start?
                    In this presentation, veteran game developer, Dan Vicarel, will provide an overview of building advertisements into mobile video games.
                    You will learn about the different kinds of ads, tools and libraries for implementing them in games, legal considerations,
                    and tips to make ads less intrusive to the player experience.
