            The description from the GDEX 2019 schedule is below.
            This talk was a pleasure to put together, as it provided a chance to stress some biology "muscles" that I hadn't used since earning
            my Bachelor of Science in Biology in 2015.
            It also presented an opportunity to work with a talented artist from Global Game Jam earlier that year,
            with whom I had built <a href="/projects/game-jams/send-them-home"><cite>Send Them Home</cite></a>.
            She was able to render some excellent alien-looking lifeforms based on my descriptions.

                    In this world-building talk, we'll take a look at games, books, and films to find examples of good and bad creature design,
                    and draw from actual biological, chemical, astronomical, and anthropological principles to form a set of rules
                    for designing lifeforms that are both fantastic AND believable.
                    This talk is intended for artists/designers of all kinds.
