                    In this world-building talk, we'll take a look at games, books, and films to find examples of good and bad creature design,
                    and draw from actual biological, chemical, astronomical, and anthropological principles to form a set of rules
                    for designing lifeforms that are both fantastic AND believable.
                    This talk is intended for artists/designers of all kinds.
                </p>
