            The description from the GDEX 2019 schedule is below.
            I should note that this talk was originally envisioned as <em>two separate</em> talks:
            one about using Unity with Visual Studio and one about using Unity with git.
            Unfortunately, I was required to combine them due to time constraints, hence the long title...

                    In this two-part presentation, Unity Certified Programmer Dan Vicarel discusses various techniques
                    to streamline your Unity workflow with the Visual Studio IDE and Git version control system,
                    drawing on over five years of professional software development experience.
                    In Part 1, Dan covers scripting for Unity in Visual Studio, including .NET profiles, C# language versions, MSBuild targets, NuGet packages, and unit testing.
                    In Part 2, he covers version control of Unity projects with Git, including Unity SmartMerge, code hosting platforms, scene/asset conflict resolution, and Git LFS.
                    All topics should provide useful, actionable knowledge for developers/programmers of all experience levels,
                    and there will be numerous "hands on" demos, so bring your laptop!
