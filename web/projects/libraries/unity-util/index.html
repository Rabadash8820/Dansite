        <p>
            This library is essentially a collection of utility classes and components that I've been building since I first adopted Unity in 2016.
            Back then, I was working on a first-person shooter, so I wrote several components related to inventory, ammo/health, projectile spawning, etc.
            As I started adding more general, utility components (for logging, dependency injection, PRNG, file I/O, etc.) and working on games in other genres
            (particularly the mobile game, <a href="/projects/mobile/hhh"><cite>High Hand Hold'em™</cite></a>)
            I decided that these components should be moved to a separate, open-source repository for reuse between projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name of this library has gone through several iterations.
            First, it was "Danware.Unity", named for the short-lived company, Danware Creations, LLC, that I founded before
            my partner and I founded <a href="https://www.derploid.com" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Derploid Entertainment, LLC</a>.
            In January 2018, I renamed this library to the organization-agnostic "UnityUtil", but the namespaces were all still under <code>UnityEngine.*</code>,
            which I thought would be simpler for consumers of the library.
            Finally, in May 2022, I decided that this was actually more <em>confusing</em>
            (it might not be clear why an API is unavailable if UnityUtil hasn't been referenced)
            and eventually renamed all namespaces to <code>UnityUtil.*</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In late 2022, I started getting more serious about documenting the library and making it publicly consumable.
            After discovering the awesome <a href="https://openupm.com/" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>OpenUPM</a> project for hosting UPM packages,
            I created a UPM manifest for the package and made plans to distribute the library that way.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of this writing in January 2024, the library is still a bit of a "monolith", with all of the logic described above contained in a single assembly (DLL).
            Once my partner and I publish <cite>High Hand Hold'em™</cite> (meaning UnityUtil has been used in an actual published game),
            then I will break up the library's <code>UnityUtil.*</code> namespaces into separate packages and release 1.0 versions of them to OpenUPM.

        <h2 class="text-center">Technical Details</h2>
        <p>I am proud of several technical details in this library:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                General code quality. I have taken great pains over the years to keep the codebase clean and up-to-date
                with the latest .NET/Unity APIs and C# language features (such as interpolated strings, null-conditional operators, file-scoped namespaces, etc.),
                use consistent formatting and identifier naming, prevent duplication and follow SOLID object-oriented design principles, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Widespread use of the dependency inversion principle to keep the code loosely coupled and testable.</li>
            <li>
                My custom utility systems, primarily those for logging, dependency injection, and input mapping.
                After discovering <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/UnityNuGet" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>UnityNuGet</a>,
                which allows much simpler use of NuGet packages in Unity,
                I am starting to replace these systems with the standard <code>Microsoft.Extensions.*</code> libraries.
                Still, I now have a very solid understanding of how DI and logging systems work in general, and the Microsoft ones in particular.
                The input mapping system is being replaced by Unity's newer
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.7/manual/index.html" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>InputSystem</a> UPM package.
            </li>
            <li>Use of MSBuild properties/targets throughout the project files to reduce duplication of language/reference versions, project configurations, etc.</li>
            <li>
                Extensive test suite. As of this writing in January 2024, there are a combined ~550 Play Mode and Edit Mode tests.
                Some of my older, more niche components do not have tests, as I hadn't learned about the
                <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.test-framework@1.3/manual/index.html" {{ site.externalLinkAttributes }}>Unity Test Framework</a> in 2016
                and was still fairly new to unit/integration testing.
                All new code is thoroughly tested though.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thorough API documentation. Again, some of my older, more niche components do not have API docs,
                as I was still new to C#'s XML documentation syntax in 2016 (and some APIs are pretty straightforward based on their names/signatures).
                More holistic documentation (mainly in the project README) is still on-going as of this writing in January 2024,
                but I pride myself on writing well-organized docs that are both detailed and clear.
            </li>
        </ul>
