# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security bugs on my website seriously. 🫡 I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub ["Open a draft security advisory"](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/Dansite/security/advisories/new) page.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, I will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party assets/packages (e.g., NPM packages or Ruby gems for Jekyll) to the person or team maintaining them.

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within one week, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to me directly at [dan.vicarel@gmail.com](mailto:dan.vicarel@gmail.com).

If I acknowledge your report but do not provide any further response or engagement within two weeks, escalation is also appropriate.
